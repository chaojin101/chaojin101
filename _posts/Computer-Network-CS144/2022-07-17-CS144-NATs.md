### 5-2 NATs - Types

Symmetric NAT

!['Symmetric NAT'](\assets\img\post\CS144\NATs\symmetric-NAT.png)

> Digestion: Symmetric NAT will translate the same internal IP with port to different NAT ports with different destination IP or port. This may cause problem, if the server is distributed, two same source requests inside a symmetric NAT have different ports mapped by NAT. if the server uses the same port to decide whether it is the same request, it will fails.

### 5-3 Implication

Transport: No New Transport!

> Digestion: When NAT software maps an address, it will check the transport protocal, if the protocal is wrong means the packet is corrupted. If a new transport protocal comes out, the NAT software will simply assume the new protocal packet is corrupted. NAT software will not add support for a new transport protocal until it is very popular, but it will not become very popular until it works across NATs.
