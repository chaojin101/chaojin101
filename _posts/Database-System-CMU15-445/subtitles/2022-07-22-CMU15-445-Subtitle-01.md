Welcome to CMU15-445/645 introduction to database systems, my name is Andy I'm the instructor for this course. As I said on Piazza I can't be in Pittsburgh right now, we are getting ready for Matt's cage fight on Wednesday, so we had to be out here in LA to prepare for that fight, so rather than just not having classes this entire first week, I wanted to record this while I'm on the road posted online and then that way when we start having in-class lectures next week we can get started on the good stuff.

So before we get into today's lecture I first want to talk about how Oracle is helping us out this semester with course development, so Oracle is actually won the first relational database management systems that came out in the 1970s, I'll will explain what a relational database is in a few slides there's one of the original ones but it's still widely used and sold today right, it's probably the second most deployed database system in the world, it's certainly the most deployed commercial system in the world, and so even though it's from the 1970s and there's other systems of the 1970s that are still sort of around or was actually still under active development and they're adding a lot of you know interesting new modern features to it, so this course is about me what I'll call it to me is traditional database management systems or a classical design and the interesting to see when they come and in the semester to give a guest to talk about some of the stuff that they're adding to Oracle today you know how they sort of go beyond you know what we'll talk about in this course and sort of look any more advanced topics.

So for this lecture here I want to first talk about these or the overall outline of what's expected in the course but you as the student taking it and then we'll finish up giving a half lecture on the relational model and the relational algebra and this sort of be the background you need to have for the various topics we'll discuss throughout the rest of the semester, so if you're a student at Carnegie Mellon then the probably the foremost thing that's on your mind is the wait list, so unfortunately this year they gave me a smaller classroom in Margaret Morrison than I wanted so that means we can't take a large number people, I think the max it says max capacity is 100, I think it's like 96 is in the room, we can being flood that number a little bit, but I mean the main takeaway is here we can't accept everyone so the wait list now I think is 115 when I checked earlier today so unfortunate that means that if you're not enrolled in the course at this point, the likelihood that you're gonna get in is very low, the people will drop the course over the next week or so and then we'll take people off the waitlist, but unfortunately I can't take everyone, so you're more than welcome to order the course just let me know that you're auditing but we can't officially hold that many people, so the way we will enroll students as current students drop out will be just on your waitlist position on s3 on a registers website, so again I'm sorry, but it's just everything's available online, so you're more than welcome to follow along if you want. 

All right so 1545 645 is at its core the course is about the design and implementation of database management systems, so that means this is not a course on how to use a database to build like an application like a website or something like that or have actually had administer a database how to deploy one set one up, we're not doing any of that, we're really focusing on how do you actually build and design the software that is a database management system, so if that's not what you're looking for it if you're not looking to know how to have a better database management system, then there's two other courses that you should consider at senior that are outside of SES and the one in particular you may want to look at is 95 7 or 3 at Heinz College, I think is Information Systems and again that's about how to like set up and administer a database management system, but you don't really understand they don't really go into detail about how you actually built the software, the other thing too that people often ask is about there's usually another course at CMU 15 415 615 something that I and professor Christopher Lewis has taught in the past that is not being offered the semester, I don't know whether it's gonna be offered in the spring probably unlikely, so right now I think the only course is available in SES would be this course 445 and then 826 in machine learning, machine learning or cross-listed in the cs department, so again meets there's always there's only Christmas myself we can't teach everything, so unfortunately there's no other database class other than this one.

All right so the course outline is that we're going through and discussing then you know how to build a disk oriented database management system and I'll explain what a disk oriented system is in a few lectures which basically we're just writing data out the disk we assume the database is on disk. So it's sort of broken up the outline for the topics we'll discussing is broken up and sort of into layers of the system right, so we'll talk at a high level what relational databases are and then we'll talk about how to store them, how sql on them, how to run transactions on them, how to recover them, if there's a crash or we need to restart the system, so up to that point up to recovery, that's the core knowledge you need to have to understand how a database management system works, and then from there we can then build on that and start talking about more you know more advanced topics like distributed databases or various other types of databases that are out there or extensions of relational databases so again like the way to think about this is we'll go through every single layer of how to actually build the system and we'll finish up and recovery and so at that point that's the basic you need to understand of how a database system works and then we'll talk about how to you know how to extend them to scale them up or scale now of running them in the cloud environment, so the right now the course website is online along with the syllabus and the schedule, so the basic outline there's a lecture twice a week, and then with each lecture there's a reading that go along with it, but better supplemental that extend the kind of things that I'll be talking about as well also provide some questions mentioned in a second, so at all times, please refer to the course webpage that should be up-to-date you know it have been up most up-to-date information on what's going on, so unfortunately we always have to talk about academic honestly, I'll go a little bit more detail what I mean about this as we go along, but when you ever have a question and you don't understand, no mean the right thing to do this, please contact me so that we can discuss whether what you're doing could be considered you know plagiarism or stealing somebody else's work right, so in general again this is an advanced course, so everyone should be aware that you don't copy coding fine, don't randomly on the Internet, you don't copy from each other, but just you know be very careful because we will check for these things and as I said all the discussion and announcements for projects lectures homeworks will be you on Piazza, will do grading with great scope, your final grade will be posted on canvas because that's what see me once, but the detonated discussion will be on Piazza and there's a link on the course web page now that'll take you to our page.
