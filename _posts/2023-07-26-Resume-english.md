## Work experience

### Shenzhen Keli Software Co., Ltd. （ 2022.9 ~ 2023.1 ）

#### Wish Wall Project

- Simple CRUD, registered users is about 500~1000.
- Design the database table according to the requirements of the product.
- Negotiate the parameters of HTTP with the front end team.
- Refer to WeChat's development documents, make users log in through WeChat.

#### Log in to the school's official website to get the information you want by programming

- Researching the login logic, and providing users with services such as class schedules and grades.
- Through packet capture, I found that the campus web client will send encrypted password to the server. After testing, I found that it is necessary to know how the password is encrypted in order to successfully log in.
- Used the browser's debugging tool to make breakpoints in the JavaScript code on the campus web client and found that AES symmetric encryption was used for the password.
- Analyzed the parameters required for encryption and how to obtain them through the [flow chart](https://static.179324.xyz/static/login-to-szu-flow-chart-827fdf2d-c63e-45f6-a46b-1c96390922b2.png).
- Programmed the login logic according to the flow chart and successfully obtained the desired data.

## Side projects

### [http package](https://github.com/chaojin101/http)

- An extension to the official Go http module.
- For example, using the post request to upload files to the server, I wrote a [user-friendly function](https://github.com/chaojin101/http#httppostmultipart).
- This package will continue to be updated. When I find that the method I need cannot be found in the official package, I will try to update it.

### [Gallery management system](https://gallery.179324.xyz/gallery)

- It is a complete, simple full-stack project that has been launched, and is used to familiarize myself with the front-end and back-end development processes.
- Learn to use Swagger UI to display [back-end API documents](https://api.gallery.179324.xyz/docs), which improves the efficiency of front-end and back-end development.
- The web client uses Service Worker and Cache to implement different request strategies for different resources to speed up resource requests.
- Using Service Worker and Cache, it realizes the feature that the web app can be used completely offline.
- The web client realizes the feature of gallery slide animation playback.
- My notes on Service Worker and Cache: [Notes](https://chaojin101.github.io/posts/web-service-worker/)

## Skills

- Have a certain understanding of basic computer knowledge, and have studied data structures and algorithms, operating systems, and computer networks.
- Know programming language, and have taken compilation principles, programming language design (C), object-oriented programming (C++), and Java programming courses during school.
- Learned Python in the programming club in high school. The needs I usually encounter are small, and I can use Python to solve them, so I am relatively familiar with Python.
- Know SQL language, MySQL database and PostgresSQL database.
- Have awareness of testing and have written unit tests on larger projects to facilitate the development and refactoring of subsequent features.
- Have learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript following [MDN tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn), and I can implement simple web pages.
- Followed the [official Vue tutorial](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) to learn the front-end development framework Vue, which increased the experience of front-end development and the management of front-end projects.
